    <string name="p1details">"Bangladesh left-hander Afif Hossain made his T20I debut in 2017 and impressed right away in his second game with a 26-ball 52 at No. 8 in a narrow win over Zimbabwe. He took a while to get going after that, although his T20I captain Mahmudullah praised his maturity during a tricky innings on a turning Mirpur pitch. In February 2022 in Chattogram, 22-year-old Afif rescued Bangladesh from 45 for 6 in a record stand with Mehidy Hasan Miraz against Afghanistan - they added an unbeaten 174, the second-highest partnership for the seventh wicket or lower in ODIs. Afif is also the youngest T20 debutant to take a five-for - he was 17 years and 72 days when he picked up 5 for 21, including the wicket of Chris Gayle, for Rajshahi Kings against Chittagong Vikings in December 2016."</string>
